Gartner's paper, "Innovation Insight for Microservices," offers a descriptive definition of microservices architecture (MSA), its benefits, liabilities as well as cultural impact of using the design. According to Gartner, microservices can be defined as “a tightly scoped, strongly encapsulated, loosely coupled, independently deployable and independently scalable application component.”
However, it warns against misinterpretation, emphasizing that the term microservices can be misused such as being a reusable service.
MSA offers a lot of benefit to organization with agility and scalability requirements. Firstly, it facilitates distributed development, enabling teams to work on different components concurrently. Additionally, MSA offers scalability and technology flexibility, allowing organizations to adapt to changing requirements and integrate new technologies seamlessly.
Despite its advantages, microservices architecture also comes with its own risks, particularly when not implemented properly. The article cautions that improper usage can lead to “perform poorly and not yield the desired agility benefits.” 
Consequently, Gartner advises organizations to evaluate their situation before adopting MSA, highlighting prerequisites such as existing architectures inhibiting desired agility and scalability and teams being ready to deploy new application infrastructure and data management. 
In instances where adopting microservices architecture may not be the optimal choice, Gartner suggests exploring alternative approaches to achieve desired agility and scalability. These alternatives include miniservices, low-code development platforms, and business process management suites.
Lastly, Gartner stresses the importance of approaching microservices architecture with caution. Organizations should not feel compelled to adopt MSA but should instead conduct thorough evaluations to determine the approach that aligns best with their goals and capabilities. 
By prioritizing careful consideration, organizations can make informed decisions that maximize the likelihood of their success in architectural design.
